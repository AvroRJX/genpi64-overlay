#
# >=app-portage/genup-1.0.18 checks for new versions of itself very
# early in the update process, switching over to the new version if
# found. This provides a convenient mechanism to address problems in
# e.g., the main @world emerge stage, which may otherwise cause the
# system to become deadlocked; but RPi3s running earlier versions
# of genup cannot be helped out by this feature, if already in a
# situation where the @world update will not run.
#
# Also, >=app-portage/genup-1.0.24 will not fail even if the initial
# update of Portage does; which is safer (since if this is failing
# due to deps, the following @world emerge may fix any soft blocks).
#
# Accordingly, this fixup script simply checks if genup is installed
# and, if so, whether its version is >=1.0.24; if <, it attempts to
# update it (the cost of doing so is small, since genup, being a
# script, requires no compilation etc.)
