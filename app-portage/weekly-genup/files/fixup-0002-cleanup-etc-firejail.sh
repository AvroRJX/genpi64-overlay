# Upgrading to sys-apps/firejail-0.9.54 can leave a massive number
# (>400) of config file 'changes' to be merged in /etc/firejail.
#
# Since these are all just new profiles, and none are overwrites, they
# *should* just be silently installed, but for some reason the Gentoo
# CONFIG_PROTECT system gets confused in this instance (on the
# gentoo-on-rpi3-64bit image anyhow).
#
# This can be overwhelming for new users trying to run dispatch-conf
# or etc-update.
#
# Accordingly, this script just auto-merges all such
# ._cfg0000_<filename> files in /etc/firejail, for which no
# /etc/firejail/<filename> counterpart exists.
