		This provides a repo post-sync hook,
		/etc/portage/repo.postsync.d/rpi3-check-porthash, which will
		be activated iff the main gentoo repo is rsync'd to the
		rsync://isshoni.org/gentoo-portage-pi64 host; in this case, the
		repo's integrity will be checked via the signed repo.hash
		master hash, and the sync aborted with an error if it does not.
		This provides assurance that the repo has not been tampered
		with, despite the use of an unauthenticated transport (rsync).
