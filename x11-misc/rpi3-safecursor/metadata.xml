		This provides a simple OpenRC service to check if the user
		has "disable_overscan=1" (uncommmented) in /boot/config.txt; if
		not, it creates a file in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/ to
		force software-based cursor blitting (this is to avoid the
		VC4 offset cursor issue with overscan, issue #17 (GitHub)).
		It also disables compositing for Xfce4 for all users.
