<longdescription>
		twofing is a daemon which runs in the background and
		recognizes two-finger gestures performed on a touchscreen
		and converts them into mouse and keyboard events.

		This way, such gestures can be used in almost all
		existing applications (even ones where you wouldnâ€™t
		expect it, like Wine applications) without having to
		modify them.

		Currently contains udev bindings for the egalax touchscreen,
		and the Raspberry Pi (1,2,3) official 7" touchscreen.
