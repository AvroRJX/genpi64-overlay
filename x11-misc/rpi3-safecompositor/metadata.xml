		This provides a simple OpenRC service to force display
		compositing off, if the system is running at a high pixel
		clock frequency. This is for safety, because some apps,
		such as LibreOffice (v6) Draw, can cause the entire system
		to lock up if used on high-res displays with window-manager
		compositing enabled.
