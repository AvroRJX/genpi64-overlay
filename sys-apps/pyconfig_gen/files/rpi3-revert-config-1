# the time you call this script, the rpi3-config-mv service will
# already have rotated /boot/config.txt to /boot/config.txt.tbc,
# and /boot/config.txt.lng to /boot.config.txt.
# This script just moves /boot/config.txt.tbc -> /boot/config.txt.rej,
# and then reboots immediately, thereby effectively reverting
# to the prior ('last-known-good') configuration.
