# Enable safe tryout of changed /boot/config.txt on the RPi3.
#
# This service runs at the boot runlevel. It rotates the boot-time
# /boot/config.txt -> /boot/config.txt.tbc, and /boot/config.txt.lng
# -> /boot/config.txt (the lng file having been created by the
# pyconfig_gen) application in the last session).
#
# A timed job is then setup to force a reboot unless the user
# intervenes to prevent it, thereby effectively rolling back
# to the prior config. This approach makes it possible to try
# out modifications to e.g. the HDMI group, without worrying
# about recovery in 'black screen' situations.
#
# # Default configuration settings can be overridden in
# /etc/conf.d/rpi3-config-mv
