# the time you call this script, the rpi3-config-mv service will
# already have rotated /boot/config.txt to /boot/config.txt.tbc,
# and /boot/config.txt.lng to /boot.config.txt.
# This script commits these changes, by moving
# /boot/config.txt to /boot/config.txt.old and
# /boot/config.txt.tbc to /boot/config.txt.
