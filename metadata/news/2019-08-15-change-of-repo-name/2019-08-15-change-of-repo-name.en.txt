Introduction
------------

In light of the forthcoming Pi4 support, I have decided to rename the
main ebuild user repository, from rpi3-overlay (repo name "rpi3" [1]) to
genpi64-overlay (repo name "genpi64"). The custom profile name has also
been changed (from default/linux/arm64/17.0/desktop/rpi3 to
default/linux/arm64/17.0/desktop/genpi64).


Migration
---------

Along with the commits migrating the repository name, you will also have
received a 'fixup' script, which will correct your
/etc/portage/repos.conf entry, and also change the repo name in entries
in the /var/db/pkg/... database.

(The GitHub URI for the project has changed, from [2] to [3], but as they
automatically redirect moved project links, your old URI should still
refer, while the migration is happening.)

This fixup script will be run automatically, within a week at most, by a
cron.weekly service already installed on your RPi. However, if you wish
to correct the repo name immediately (or you have the weekly fixup
service disabled), then simply issue the following command on your RPi
(if running as demouser, prefix them with sudo):

pi64 ~ # /etc/cron.weekly/fixup

Results may be viewed in /var/log/latest-fixup-run.log (the relevant
fixup is number 0007, and lives at [4] pre-migration, and [5]
post-migration). It does nothing on a system where the name has already
been migrated.

Once complete, run the follow to update your eix cache:

pi64 ~ # eix-sync -0

(that's a zero).

Then, run the following, to make sure your weekly fixup service can
still locate files in the moved repo:

pi64 ~ # emerge -vu app-portage/weekly-genup


Testing
-------

Once migration has completed, make sure that:

pi64 ~ # emaint sync --repo genpi64

completes without errors. Also run

pi64 ~ # eselect profile show

and check it returns

  Current /etc/portage/make.profile symlink:
    genpi64:default/linux/arm64/17.0/desktop/genpi64

If so, congratulations! You have successfully migrated repos.


Post-Migration Use
------------------

Once the migration has taken place, you will need to use:

pi64 ~ # emaint sync --repo genpi64

wherever once you used:

pi64 ~ # emaint sync --repo rpi3

Otherwise, nothing else should change (packages installed from the
binhost do not need reinstallation, or anything like that).

If you experience any issues with this migration process, please feel
free to contact me.

Best, sakaki <sakaki@deciban.com>
